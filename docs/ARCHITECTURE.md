# System Architecture

## Overview
The ImageBuilder Backend is a FastAPI-based service that provides image generation capabilities using AI models. It uses Supabase for authentication and storage, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## System Components

### 1. API Layer (FastAPI)
- Handles HTTP requests and responses
- Implements REST API endpoints
- Manages request validation and error handling
- Provides OpenAPI documentation

### 2. Authentication (Supabase)
- JWT-based authentication
- User management and session handling
- Role-based access control

### 3. Database (PostgreSQL via Supabase)
- Stores user data
- Manages image metadata
- Handles relationships between entities

### 4. AI Integration
- OpenAI integration for image generation
- Runway ML integration for style transfer
- Async processing of image generation requests

### 5. Storage (Supabase Storage)
- Image file storage
- CDN delivery of generated images
- Secure access control

## Data Flow

1. Client makes authenticated request
2. API validates request and permissions
3. Request processed by appropriate service
4. AI models generate images
5. Images stored in Supabase storage
6. Metadata saved to database
7. Response returned to client

## Security Measures

1. JWT Authentication
   - Token-based access control
   - Secure password hashing
   - Role-based permissions

2. API Security
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - CORS protection

3. Data Security
   - Encrypted storage
   - Secure file handling
   - Environment variable protection

## Scalability Considerations

1. Horizontal Scaling
   - Containerized deployment
   - Load balancer ready
   - Stateless design

2. Performance
   - Async request handling
   - Database connection pooling
   - Caching strategies

3. Monitoring
   - Error logging
   - Performance metrics
   - Health checks
